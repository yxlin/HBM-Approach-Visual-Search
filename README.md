HBM-Approach-Visual-Search
==========================

Using HBM to test Palmer et al's (2011) and Wolfe et al's (2010) benchmark visual search (slightly modified) paradigms in the context of target-distractors relation. The aim of this project is to see if we can probe, if there is any, cognitive processes, using HBM. The target cognitive process is the grouping effect (i.e., similarity amongst target and distractors).  We collected, relatively speaking, a small data set, using a very similar paradigm  and tested it with HBM.  The results were compared with Palmer et al's (2011) and Wolfe et al's (2010) findings.  We expect the grouping effect might influence RT shape, but not RT scale and RT shift.
