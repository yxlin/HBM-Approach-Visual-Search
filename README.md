HBM-Approach-Visual-Search
==========================

Using HBM approach to test Palmer et al's (2011) and Wolfe et al's (2010) benchmark visual search (slightly modified) 
paradigm in the context of target-distracters relation. The aim of this project is to see if we can probe, if there is 
any,high-level cognitive processes, using HBM.  The target cognitive process is the grouping effect (i.e., homogeneous 
distracter).  We expect the grouping effect will influence the distribution shape, but not the scale and shift 
(i.e., the presumed threshold index).    

This is a work in progress. Please inform the authors (i.e., me, (I am one of them)), if you find some information here 
is useful for your work and wish to use it.  I am very welcome for any comments that help me to improve the work. If you

We thank Even Palmer and Jeremy Wolfe kindly provide their visual search data at 
http://search.bwh.harvard.edu/new/data_set.html, as well as their permission for us use the data set.
