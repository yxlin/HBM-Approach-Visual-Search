HBM-Approach-Visual-Search
==========================

Using HBM to test Palmer et al's (2011) and Wolfe et al's (2010) benchmark visual search (slightly modified) paradigms in the context of target-distractors relation. The aim of this project is to see if we can probe, if there is any, cognitive processes, using HBM. The target cognitive process is the mechanism of search group segmentation, (see the SERR model of visual search in Humphreys & MÃ¼ller, 1993).  We collected, relatively speaking, a small data set, using similar paradigms  and tested it in the HBM. The results were compared with Palmer et al's (2011) and Wolfe et al's (2010) findings. 

We thank Jeremy Wolfe and Evan Palmer kindly provide their visual search data at
