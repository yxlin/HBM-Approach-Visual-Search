1. This program tested Wolfe et al.'s (2010) visual search paradigms. Search items were presented on a invisible circle with diameter set in searchTabFun.R.  
2. Two factors were examined.  Firstly, we investigated target present versus absent. Secondly, we compared different display sizes (4, 8, 12, vs. 16).  See search.R for implementation details.  
3. The task includes 8 practice trials and 800 test trials.
